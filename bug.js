This error typically occurs when using Expo's `expo prebuild` command in conjunction with custom native modules.  The core issue lies in misconfigurations within your project's build process, specifically how Expo handles linking native dependencies.  The error message itself is vague and might not immediately pinpoint the source of the problem.  It frequently points to a failure in building the Android or iOS project and manifests as a failed build process.
