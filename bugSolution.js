// Solutions to fix vague Expo prebuild errors with custom native modules

// 1. Verify Native Module Configuration:
//    Ensure that your custom native module is correctly configured and linked within your Expo project.
//    Follow the official Expo documentation for integrating native modules.
//    Check your Podfile (iOS) and build.gradle (Android) for proper settings.

// 2. Detailed Logging:
//    Add more verbose logging to your native module build scripts to capture more details during the build process.
    // This will help pinpoint the exact stage where the error occurs.

// 3. Clean Build:
//    Perform a clean build of your project to remove any potential build artifacts that might be causing conflicts:
//    expo prebuild --clean

// 4. Version Compatibility:
//    Verify that your Expo CLI version, Expo SDK version, and native module dependencies are compatible.
//    Check the release notes and compatibility matrices of each component to ensure they are aligned.

// 5. Android Specific Troubleshooting:
//    If the error is Android related, check your Android build environment setup. Ensure you have the Android SDK installed and properly configured.
    // Review your `android/app/build.gradle` file for any potential issues.

// 6. iOS Specific Troubleshooting:
//    If the error is iOS related, check your iOS build environment. Ensure you have Xcode installed and properly configured.
//    Review your `ios/Podfile` and ensure all dependencies are correctly specified and resolved.

// 7. Check for conflicting dependencies:
//    Ensure that your dependencies do not conflict with each other. Use a tool such as `npm ls` or `yarn why` to investigate.

// 8. Expo Updates:
//    Ensure that you are using the latest version of Expo CLI and SDK.
    // Updating often includes bug fixes and improvements to native module integration.

// Example of adding more verbose logging to a native module (example - adjust to your native module):
// (within your native module's Android build.gradle)
android {
    ...other settings...
    buildTypes {
        release {
            buildConfigField "String", "DEBUG_TAG", "MyNativeModule"
            // Add your custom log statements to help identify errors
            // e.g., println "Building Native Module: $DEBUG_TAG"
        }
    }
